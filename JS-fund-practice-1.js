// Recreate the description variable from the last assignment, this time using the template literal syntax.
// 'Portugal is in Europe, and its 11 million people speak portuguese'.

console.log("-------------------------------- Taking Decisions: if / else Statements");

// If your country's population is greater than 33 million, log a string like this to the console: "Portugal's population is 22 million below average" (the 22 is the average of 33 minus the country's population).

// After checking the result, change the population temporarily to 13 and then to 130. See the different results, and set the population back to original.

// Predict the result of these 5 operations without executing them:

// "9" - "5"
// "19" - "13" + "17"
// "19" - "13" + 17
// "123" < 57
// 5 + 6 + "4" + 9 - 4 - 2
// Execute the operations to check if you were right.

console.log("-------------------------------- Equality Operators: == vs. ===");

// Declare a variable numNeighbours based on a prompt input like this:

// prompt('How many neighbour countries does your contry have?');
// If there is only 1 neighbour, log to the console 'Only 1 border!' (use loose equality == for now).

// Use an else-if block to log 'More than 1 border' in case numNeighbours is greater than 1.

// Use an else block to log 'No borders' (this block will be executed when numNeighbours is 0 or any other value).

// Test the code with different values of numNeighbours, including 1 and 0.

// Change == to ===, and test the code again, with the same values of numNeighbours. Notice what happens when there is exactly 1 border! Why is this happening?

// Finally, convert numNeighbours to a number, and watch what happens now when you input 1.

// Reflect on why we should use the === operator and type conversion in this situation.

// const numNeighbours = Number(prompt("How many neighbor countries does you country have?"));
// console.log(numNeighbours);

console.log("-------------------------------- Logical Operators");

// Comment out the previous code so the prompt doesn't get in the way.

// Let's say Sarah is looking for a new country to live in. She wants to live in a country that speaks English, has less than 50 million people and is not an island.

// Write an if statement to help Sarah figure out if your country is right for her. You will need to write a condition that accounts for all of Sarah's criteria. Take your time with this, and check part of the solution if necessary.

// If yours is the right country, log a strings like this 'You should live in Portugal :)'. If not, log 'Portugal does not meet your criteria :('.

// Probably your country does not meet all the criteria. So go back and temporarily change some variables in order to make the condition true (unless you live in Canada :D).

console.log("-------------------------------- The switch Statement");

// Use a switch statement to log the following string for the given language:

// chinese or mandarin: 'MOST number of native speakers!';
// spanish: '2nd place in number of native speakers';
// english: '3rd place';
// hindi: 'Number 4';
// arabic: '5th most spoken language';
// for all other simply log 'Great language too :D'.

// const languageRanking = "Enter Language Here";

console.log("-------------------------------- The Conditional (Ternary) Operator");

// If your country's population is greater than 33 million, use the ternary operator to log a string like this to the console: "Portugal's population is above average". Otherwise, simply log "Portugal's population is below average". Notice how only one word change between these two sentences!

// After checking the result, change the population temporarily to 13 and then to 130. See the different results, and set the population back to original.
